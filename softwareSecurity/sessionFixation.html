		<h1> # FIX OWASP 2013 A2: SESSION FIXATION </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
<xmp>
	The session fixation vulnerability happens when user sessions are not handled properly.
	For instance, if the same cookies are used when changes in priveledge occur, this vulnerability aries. 
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
<xmp>
	# From index.php
	<?
		...
		if($operation == "login"){
			$user=$_REQUEST['user'];
			$password=$_REQUEST['password'];
			$dbconn = pg_connect_db();
			$query= "SELECT id, username, firstName, lastName, passwd FROM account WHERE username='$user' AND passwd='$password'";
			$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $query);
			$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
			if($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {
				$_SESSION['accountId']=$row[0];
				$_SESSION['user']=$row[1];
				$_SESSION['firstName']=$row[2];
				$_SESSION['lastName']=$row[3];
				$_SESSION['isLoggedIn']=True;
			} else {
				$g_debug = "$user not logged in";
				$_SESSION['isLoggedIn']=False;
			}
		}
		...
		elseif($operation == "logout"){
			unset($_SESSION);
			$_SESSION['isLoggedIn']=False;
		}
		...
	...
	?>
	
	When logging in and out (change of priveledge), nothing is done to refresh or delete the session.

</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> How attacker exploits this: 
<xmp>
	The attacker can use a public machine and access fourFours. They can then record the value of the assigned cookie, leave the 
	browser open, and then wait for someone else to access the website. Once another person logs into fourFours from that same machine,
	the cookie now becomes the cookie of an authenticated user until the victim logs out. The attacker can now use tools such as 
	Netcat to communicate with fourFours with the now authenticated cookie. The hacker can now delete and add expressions on the behalf
	of the victim and in a more general case they'd probably be able to do more damaging things such as changing a password or email address. 

	This can also be done remotly, the attacker can establish a connection with the web server to get a sessionID. The attacker can then send an email to
	the victim with a malicious link containing JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser. That code would change the victim's sessionID to the
	hacker's sessionID, and since it doesn't get changed when changes in privelege occur, when the victim logs in, that sessionID will now be authenticated and 
	the attacker will be able to use it to gain access to the victim's account.

</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details
<xmp>
	This compromises authentication (A) as attackers can be logged in as other users and perform actions on their behalf.
	Moreover, this breaches integrity (I) as attacker can use the user's priveleges to make changes to their data (and possibly others).
</xmp>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>
<xmp>
	We can verify this by logging into the Kali Linux VM and launching Mozilla Firefox.
	On the top right we open the menu and locate and click on Web Developer. Then we press on Toggle tools.
	We then visit the website http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/
	In the Network tab, we click on the top entry which will show us the GET request made to fourFours.
	We then switch to the cookies tab where we will see the value of the session:

		PHPSESSID: f72590fb2a37e56134cb594a310e5210
	
	We then log in using Jay Perlmuter's credentials for example --> username: perl and password: perl
	After logging in, we check the value of the cookie just like above and we find:

		PHPSESSID: f72590fb2a37e56134cb594a310e5210
	
	The sessionID stayed the same after a change in privelege confirming this vulnerability.

</xmp>

</xmp>
                <h2> The Fix </h2>
                <ul>
                        <li> Explain the fix:
<xmp>
	When the user successfuly logs in, we want to delete the previous sessionID and create a new one to
	make the sessionID the attacker obtained useless.
	To fix this, we can use the session_regenerate_id() php function.
	It will replace the current session id with a new one, and keep the current session information. Passing in True 
	as a parameter destroys the old associated session file.
	With this implementation, everytime the user logs in, a new sessionID will be created and the older one will be
	destroyed.

	# From index_fixed.php
	<?	
		...
		if($operation == "login"){
			...
			if($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {
				...
				session_regenerate_id(True);
			}
		}
		...
		elseif($operation == "logout"){
			...
			session_destroy();
		}
		...
	?>
	...
</xmp>
                        </li>
                        <li> How the fix resolves the issue:
<xmp>
	Attack scenario #1:

		Say an attacker established a connection with the web server and got a sessionID and was able to change the victim's sessionID to
		the one they just got.

	Attack scenario #2:

		Say an attacker visited fourFours on a public computer and recorded the sessionID they got and the victim is now using that same computer
		and is about to login.

	In both scenarios, as soon as the user logs in, the sessionID the attacker had is destroyed and thus can't be used anymore. Any attempt to 
	authenticate with the old sessionID won't work.
