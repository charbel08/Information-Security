		<h1> # FIX OWASP 2013 A4: INSECURE DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCES </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
<xmp>
	Insecure direct object references vulnerability arises when an application allows the user's input to
	directly reference data in the backend. In other words, it's when an application exposes a reference to 
	an internal implementation object. This allows users to see the real identifiers (such as database keys)
	and patterns of elements in the backend.
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
<xmp>
	# From index.php
	<?
		...
		elseif($operation == "deleteExpression"){
			$expressionId = $_REQUEST['expressionId'];
			$accountId=$_REQUEST['accountId']; 
			$dbconn = pg_connect_db();
			$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "DELETE FROM solution WHERE id=$expressionId AND accountId=$accountId");
			$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		} elseif($operation == "addExpression"){
			$expression = $_REQUEST['expression'];
			$value=$_REQUEST['value'];
			$accountId=$_REQUEST['accountId'];
		}
		...
	?>
	<html>
		...
		<?
			...
			if($expressionAccountId==$g_accountId){
				$deleteLink="<a href=\"?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=$expressionId&accountId=$g_accountId\"><img src=\"delete.png\" width=\"20\" border=\"0\" /></a>";
			}
			...
		?>
		<tr> 
			<form method="post">
				<td><input type="text" name="expression"/> </td>
				<td><input type="submit" value="add"/></td>
				<input type="hidden" name="value" value="<?=$i?>"/>
				<input type="hidden" name="operation" value="addExpression"/>
				<input type="hidden" name="accountId" value="<?=$g_accountId ?>"/>
			</form>
		</tr>
		...
	</html>
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> How attacker exploits this: 
<xmp>
	The attacker starts off by adding an expression, let's call that expression X.
	After X is added, we now have the option to delete it. By hovering the mouse on the delete icon or 
	by deleting the expression we can see what URL will be loaded. It would look like this if we 
	were logged in as Jay Perlmuter and we wanted to delete the first expression in the database:

		http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=1&accountId=10
	
	The attacker can now test the predictability of the IDs by adding another expression Y.
	When deleting the second expression Y, the follwoing URL is generated:
	
		http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=2&accountId=10
	
	The attacker notices that the expressionId incremented by 1 when he added a new one, indicating that the
	IDs have a pattern to them. The attacker can use an enumeration attack to figure out the pattern but in
	this case it is obvious. And since the IDs in the URL directely reference elements in the database, changing
	them in the URL will change the database.
	In this case, it's insecure because the accountIds are also leaking to the front end. Based on what the attacker
	saw from expressionIds, he can test values for accountIds (0 to 10 for example) and delete the expression of another
	user. (accountIds are also leaking when adding an expression)

	After a bit of trial and error, the attacker has figured out that the accountId of Anne Lion is 2 and that some of her expressions
	have expressionIds 3, 4, 5.
	He can now delete another one of her expressions by using the following URL:

		http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=6&accountId=2
	
	The attacker can do this for any user and keep deleting expressions that aren't his.
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details
<xmp>
	This compromises integrity (I) as other user's information does not remain unchanged in storage. This change is done by
	an unauthorized party. This also breaches authentication (A) as the attacker can perform actions on other users behalf 
	without the proper permissions.
</xmp>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>
<xmp>
</xmp>
<xmp>
	To verify this, we first log into the database and look at the solution table:

		fourfours=> select * from solution;
	
	And we get the following table (in my case):

		id | value | expression | accountid 
	      ----+-------+------------+-----------
		3 |     0 |            |        10
		4 |     1 | 4/4        |         2
		5 |     2 | 4/4/4      |         2
		6 |     3 | 4/4/4/4/4  |         2
		(4 rows)
	
	User with accountID 2 has 3 expressions with IDs 4, 5 and 6.
	Now that we have this information, let's test whether we can delete a user's entry
	when logged in as another user. 

	We load fourFours in our browser:

		http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/
	
	And log in as Jay Perlmuter --> username: perl and password: perl
	Now let's see if we can delete Anne's 4/4 entry.
	We craft the following URL:

		http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=4&accountId=2
	
	Anne's 4/4 entry has been deleted. This confirms the vulnerability.
	We can even see in the database that the entry is gone:

		fourfours=> select * from solution;
		id | value | expression | accountid 
		----+-------+------------+-----------
		3 |     0 |            |        10
		5 |     2 | 4/4/4      |         2
		6 |     3 | 4/4/4/4/4  |         2
		(3 rows)
</xmp>
                <h2> The Fix </h2>
                <ul>
                        <li> Explain the fix:
<xmp>
	To fix this, we'll use an indirect reference map.
	When the user logs in, we create a dictionary that maps the hashed expressionIds to the actual expressionIds that are particular to the user.
	We then store the map in the user's session.
	In the front end, the expressionId is now hashed, hiding any kind of pattern from the attacker. 
	When a user deletes an entry, the hashed expressionId is looked up in the map to find the actual expressionId and that
	value is used to access the database. That expressionId is then deleted from the map.
	When a user adds an entry, the map in the cookie has the new expressionId and its corresponding hash added to it. 

	Moreover, we made it so that the accountId is no longer taken from the request, instead it is taken from the session both when adding and 
	deleting an expression.

	<?	
		...
		if($operation == "login"){
			...
			# Creating hash map to store our indirect references and storing them in cookies
			$hash_map = array();

			while ($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {
				$hash_map[hash('sha256', "saltexpression" . $row[0])] = $row[0];
			}
			$_SESSION['expressionMap']=$hash_map;

			# Note: htmlentities is for XSS fix
			# Getting the un-hashed version of expressionId 
			$expressionId = $_SESSION['expressionMap'][htmlentities($_REQUEST['expressionId'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')];

			$dbconn = pg_connect_db();
			$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "statement2", 'DELETE FROM solution WHERE id=$1 AND accountId=$2;');
			# accounId is now taken from the session instead of the request
			$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "statement2", array($expressionId, $_SESSION['accountId']));

			# Note: htmlentities is for XSS fix
			# Removing expressionId from expression map

				$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "statement5", array($value, $expression, $accountId));
				$row = pg_fetch_row($result);

				# Adding the new expressionId to the expression map

                        <li> How the fix resolves the issue:
<xmp>
	Attack scenario:

		The attacker is logged in and wants to delete another user's entry.
		The attacker wants to look for some patterns or leaks from the backend to the frontend, but the URL looks like this:

		https://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index_fixed.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=4e07408562bedb8b60ce05c1decfe3ad16b72230967de01f640b7e4729b49fce
		&token=253cf988d09e9cb82b8be0c5cf85e7374538cad4b00418478c5fafda7b65c7f1

		Note: the token part of the URL is for the CSRF vulnerability
		The expressionId is now hashed and has no visible pattern and does not reference an expressionId directly.
		Even if the attacker knew what expressionId belonged to the victim, they wouldn't be able to use it unless they found the right hash.
		But even with the right hash, the accountId is no longer taken from the request, so no unecessary information is leaked to the attacker 
		and they can't target other users anymore. accountId was also removed from the 'adding a new expression' operation.
