		<h1> # FIX OWASP A8: CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
<xmp>
	CSRF vulnerability can arise when the website relies solely on the cookie to authorize user
	requests. This becomes an issue when relevant actions can be performed through the URL 
	(or even through POST requests) and the attacker misleads the victim to perform actions 
	they did not intend.
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
<xmp>
	# From index.php
	<?
		session_start(); 
		# No verification is made before processing a request
		if(!isset($_SESSION['isLoggedIn']))$_SESSION['isLoggedIn']=False;
		$operation=$_REQUEST['operation'];
		$g_debug="";
		$g_errors="";
		...
		if($operation == "login"){
			...
			# Nothing is done to tokenize when the user logs in
			if($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {
				$_SESSION['accountId']=$row[0];
				$_SESSION['user']=$row[1];
				$_SESSION['firstName']=$row[2];
				$_SESSION['lastName']=$row[3];
				$_SESSION['isLoggedIn']=True;
			}
			...
		}
		...
	?>
	<html>
		...
		<? if($g_isLoggedIn){ ?>
			<a href=?operation=logout>Logout</a>
		...
		<?php
			...
			$deleteLink="<a href=\"?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=$expressionId&accountId=$g_accountId\"><img src=\"delete.png\" width=\"20\" border=\"0\" /></a>";
			...
		?>
		<tr> 
			<form method="post">
				<td><input type="text" name="expression"/> </td>
				<td><input type="submit" value="add"/></td>
				<input type="hidden" name="value" value="<?=$i?>"/>
				<input type="hidden" name="operation" value="addExpression"/>
				<input type="hidden" name="accountId" value="<?=$g_accountId ?>"/>
			</form>
		</tr>
		...
	</html>
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> How attacker exploits this: 
<xmp>
	The attacker wants to get a user to delete their own expression by crafting a malicious URL.
	They can see that the delete URL follows this format:

		http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=3&accountId=2
	
	The expressionIds seem to be predictable (just like in InsercureDirectObjectReferences.html). 
	In this case, accountId=2 belongs to Anne Lion. If an attacker had this URL or was able to get the accountId 
	and expressionId through other means, they would be able to use social engineering to get Anne to delete
	one of her own expressions. 
	
	In this case, the attacker would keep the accountId the same and change the expressionId to 4 for example:

		http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=4&accountId=2

	The attacker can then send this URL to Anne in hopes that she clicks on it. This is where social engineering comes in.
	The attacker can hide the URL as an ordinary link for instance, making it tempting for Anne to click on it:

		<a href="http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=4&accountId=2">View my Pictures!</a>
	
	By clicking this link, Anne will delete one of her own entries, which is not what she intended. And since the expressionIds are predictable,
	the attacker can iterate through them to see which cause a deletion and which don't.
	The attacker can also force Anne to logout or add an expression using this same method, but adapted to POST requests using FORM tags.
	The attacker can even use Anne to delete the expressions of other users.

</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details
<xmp>
	This compromises integrity (I) since the user's data gets modified unintentionally. The deletion was caused by an unauthorized
	party. This also breaches authentication (A) as the attacker is not logged in and forces the victim to make changes that require
	the right permission.
</xmp>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>
<xmp>
	To verify this vulnerability, we can first take a look at the database (in my case):

		fourfours=> select * from solution;                                                                
		id | value | expression | accountid 
	      ----+-------+------------+-----------
		2 |     1 | 4/4        |         2
		3 |     8 | 4+4        |         2
		4 |    16 | 4*4        |         2
		5 |     0 | 4-4        |        10
		(4 rows)
	
	We can see the accountId and expressionIds of Anne Lion.
	We can craft the following URL:

		http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=3&accountId=2
	
	We then open a browser and load the website:

		http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/

	We now log in as Anne Lion --> username: Anne and password: Lion  
	(we can find these by looking at the account table, select * from account;)

	In a new tab, we load the crafted URL, this will take us to the login page.
	However, if we look at the solution table:

		fourfours=> select * from solution;                                                                
		id | value | expression | accountid 
		  ----+-------+------------+-----------
		2 |     1 | 4/4        |         2
		4 |    16 | 4*4        |         2
		5 |     0 | 4-4        |        10
		(3 rows)

	We can see that the expression with expressionId=2 has been deleted, confirming the vulnerability.
	It's also important to note that only a loading screen showed up, which would probabliy not raise any
	suspisions by the victim and might just be brushed off as a weird bug. 

</xmp>
		<h2> The Fix </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Explain the fix: 
<xmp>
	We fix this by creating a random page token everytime the user logs in. This token will be checked everytime for
	every request (logout, addExpression, deleteExpression).
	So every GET or POST request includes this token. 
	At the start of a request, the token received from a request is checked with the one
	in the cookie to make sure they match. If not, then an exception is raised.

	# From index_fixed.php
	<?
		session_start(); 
		if(!isset($_SESSION['isLoggedIn']))$_SESSION['isLoggedIn']=False;

		# Checking that token check happens when a user is logged in to avoid blocking the login screen with
		# the exception
		if(count($_GET) + count($_POST) > 0 && $_SESSION['isLoggedIn']){
			if(!isset($_REQUEST['token'])){
				throw new Exception('Token not found');
			}
			elseif(strcmp($_REQUEST['token'], $_SESSION['token']) <> 0){
				throw new Exception('No token match');
			}
		}
		...
		if($operation == "login"){
			...
			if($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {
				...
				# Creating a random token when the user successfully logs in
				# Using username as salt
				$_SESSION['token'] = hash('sha256', $user . uniqid(rand(), true));
				...
			}
		}
		...
	?>
	<html>
		...
		<? if($g_isLoggedIn){ ?>
			<! -- Adding the token to the logout request-->
			<a href=?operation=logout&token=<?php echo $_SESSION['token']?>>Logout</a>
			...
			<?php
				<! -- Adding the token to the delete request-->
				...
				$rt = $_SESSION['token'];
				...
				$deleteLink="<a href=\"?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=$expressionId&token=$rt\"><img src=\"delete.png\" width=\"20\" border=\"0\" /></a>";
				...
			?>
			<form method="post">
				<! -- Adding the token to the add expression request as a hidden variable-->
				...
				<input type="hidden" name="token" value="<?= $_SESSION['token']; ?>">
				...
			</form>
			...
	</html>
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> How the fix resolves the issue:
<xmp>
	Attack scenario:

		Victim (Anne) has received an email from the attacker (Jay) with a link to view vacation pictures. 
		Hidden in the link is the following URL:

			http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index_fixed.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=3&accountId=2

		By clicking on it, Anne's browser displays an error message:

			Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'Token not found' in /var/www/fourFours/index_fixed.php:24
			Stack trace: #0 {main} thrown in /var/www/fourFours/index_fixed.php on line 24
		
		This attack was prevented. But the attacker could supply a valid token since Jay has an account:

			https://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index_fixed.php?operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=3&accountId=2
			&token=1f1f595e7538dc583b0256d44b6023c7782a129f97a11faa6b74d00367ab46fd --> token was taken from Jay's account after logging in as him.

		When Anne clicks on this link, it leads the browser to output the following error:

			Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'No token match' in /var/www/fourFours/index_fixed.php:27 
			Stack trace: #0 {main} thrown in /var/www/fourFours/index_fixed.php on line 27
		
		Both attacks have been prevented.
