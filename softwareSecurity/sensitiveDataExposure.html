		<h1> # FIX OWASP A6: SENSITIVE DATA EXPOSURE </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
<xmp>
	This vulnerability occurs when sensitive user information is not properly protected.
	Things like passwords for example not being hashed allows anyone that has access to the
	database to see them and get credentials to log into accounts that aren't theirs.
	Another cause could be from not using HTTPS, allowing data to be exposed. 
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
<xmp>
	# From schema.sql
	create table account (
        id serial primary key,
        username varchar(50) UNIQUE,
        passwd varchar(50) NOT NULL, <-- 50 characters is not enough for SHA256 hashing
        firstName varchar(50),
        lastName varchar(50)
	);

	# From index.php
	<?
		...
		if($operation == "login"){
			$user=$_REQUEST['user'];
			$password=$_REQUEST['password'];
			...
	?> 
	...

	# From the account table in fourFours database
	fourfours=> select * from account;                                             
	id |       username        |     passwd     | firstname |  lastname

</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> How attacker exploits this: 
<xmp>
	If an attacker is able to access this table through an SQL injection attack (or through other means). They will be able to use the information
	from the table to log into any user's account. With this data, they can simply load http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php in their browser
	and enter user name: perl and password: perl to log in as Jay Perlmuter (for example). They can log in as any user and modify the website
	(delete and add expressions) on the behalf of anyone.
	Moreover, since the application is not using https to communicate, the attacker has another way of exploiting this vulnerability.
	HTTP does not use an encryption layer, exposing data and allowing it to be intercepted by other users on the same network. The attacker
	can use a man in the middle attack, where they listen (or maybe even modify) the communication between the victim's computer and the server.


</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details
<xmp>
	Sensitive data exposure compromises confidentiality (C), as sensitive user information can get disclosed to unauthorized parties.
	If the account table is accessed by the attacker, the hacker can then modify the fourFours website as they please. 
</xmp>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>
<xmp>
	To verify that the vulnerability exists, we can start by accessing the database with:

		psql -U ff -d fourfours -h localhost # find the password in the index.php script
	
	We start by printing the account table:
		
		fourfours=> select * from account;

	To which we get:

		id |       username        |     passwd     | firstname |  lastname

	We can clearly see that the passwords are not hashed, confirming the sensitive data exposure vulnerability.

	Moreover, we can see in the URL that http is used and not https: http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php 
	Most browsers also tell the users that the connection is not secure if https isn't used.

                <h2> The Fix </h2>
                <ul>
                        <li> Explain the fix:
<xmp>
	First, we need to hash the database passwords.
	To do this, we can run a script that hashes all the password in the database.
	The php script is called hash_database.php and contains this code:

		# From hash_database.php
		<?
		function pg_connect_db(){
			$dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=fourfours user=ff host=localhost password=adg135sfh246");
			pg_set_client_encoding($dbconn, 'UTF8');
			return $dbconn;
		}

		$dbconn = pg_connect_db();
		$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", 'alter table account alter column passwd type character varying(70);');
		$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", 'SELECT * FROM account');
		$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		while ($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {
			$user = $row[1];
			$password = $row[2];
			# Using the username as salt
			$hashed_password = hash('sha256', $user . $password);
			$result2 = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "UPDATE account SET passwd='$hashed_password' WHERE username='$user' AND passwd='$password';");
			$result2 = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		}
		echo "done"
	?>

	This will hash every user's password in the account table and uses the username as salt.
	We now need to fix the authentication to hash the user's inputted password, we also need to add code to switch to https:
		
		# From index_fixed.php
		<?	
			...
			if (!isset($_SERVER['HTTPS'])) {
				header('Location: https://' . $_SERVER["SERVER_NAME"] . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
			}
			...
			if($operation == "login"){
				$user=$_REQUEST['user'];
				$password = hash('sha256', $user . $_REQUEST['password']);
				...
		?> 
		...
	
	The user can now login and the password will be stored securily. Moreover, now the only people that know the passwords are the users themeselves.
	Note: the fourfoursuser table is quite redundant and also exposes sensitive data. As it is not used by the website, it might be best to just drop it: DROP TABLE fourfoursuser;
	
	To get the https section above to work, we need to configure a few things on the Ubuntu804Server.
	We'll start by getting an SSL Certificate, for the purposes of this assignment we'll use a self signed certificate:

		openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout fourFours.key -out fourFours.crt
	
	This will generate two files, fourFours.key and fourFours.crt which we'll place in /etc/ssl
	On Ubuntu, each site has a separate configuration that can be found at /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ so we run:

		cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
	
	Then we need to create a configuration file for fourFours, we do this with:

		touch fourFours.conf
	
	And we add to it the following code:

		<VirtualHost 192.168.10.100:443>
		DocumentRoot /var/www/
		ServerName 192.168.10.100
		SSLEngine on
		SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/fourFours.crt
		SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/fourFours.key
		</VirtualHost>
	
	Finally, we restart apache with:

		/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
	
	Launching the website we can see that https is being used.

                        <li> How the fix resolves the issue:
<xmp>
	Attack scenario:
		An attacker has found their way to the database and wants to get user passwords to log in.
		Let's say they were able to access the table using SQL injections and sqlmap: 

			sqlmap -u http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php --data "user=hi&password=hi&operation=login" --method POST -D public -T account --dump
		
		With the following output:

			Database: public
			Table: account
			[15 entries]

			+------+------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------+-----------------------+-----------+
		
		The passwd column now contains salted hashed password.
		The attacker can try logging in with username: bigBoy and password: c8863587b5928a07761f541e17af9599eaa7db75c48dea5a6659fa3adafd28c4 but the 
		site would say 'bigBoy not logged in' as hashes are one way functions.
	
	In the case of https, if the attacker found a way to listen to the communication between the user and the server, the data would now be encrypted as well.
