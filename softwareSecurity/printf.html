		<h1> Example: printf format string vulnerability </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
<xmp>
The printf format string vulnerability arises when the user
provides a string that is used as the format string argument
to printf(fmt, args); 
</xmp>
			</li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
<xmp>

		</ul>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>
<xmp>
When the system requests:

	Input name:

The user provides input:

	Arn %x ld
	
The system responds with (for example):

	Hi Arn bfff23 ld

If there was no printf vulnerability, we would expect:

	Hi Arn %x ld

The difference is that the %x appears to be replaced with a
hex value (bfff23) in the above example, indicating that a printf format string
is derived directly from the users input at "Input name:"
